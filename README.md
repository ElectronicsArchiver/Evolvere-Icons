## Design

- Minimalist / Monochromatic
- Realistic Shading

  *As far as I'm able to~*
  
- Smooth Colors
- Square
- Small

## Variants

The variants have been removed and will be replaced with a script that will generate a custom theme with the desired colors (I promise xD). You can play with the old variants in the [old repository](https://github.com/franksouza183/EvolvereSuit).

Compatible with some windows (wine) applications.

## Installation

1. Download the latest **[Release]** .

2. Extract the archive.

3. Place them in corresponding directory:

  **System:** `/usr/share/icons/evolvere-icons`

  **User:** `~/.icons/evolvere-icons`
  
4. Use your theming tool to select it.

## Notes

#### Small Icons

All icons smaller or equal to `24px` are monochromatic, <br>with very few exceptions, preventing consistency break.

So, if you see small colorful icons, it is because they <br>
haven't been covered yet or maybe it's hard-coded.

#### Transitioning

The package is in the process of migrating to <br>
the new style, so expect icons with the old one.

*I am currently focusing on the most popular.*

#### Dark Themes

When using dark themes, the small <br>
icons will be visible by bright outlines.

#### Live Preview

Open `Resources/preview.svg` <br>
in **[Inkscape]** for a *'live'* preview.
