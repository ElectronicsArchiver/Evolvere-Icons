## Notes

#### Variants

The variants have been removed and will be replaced <br>
with a script that will generate a custom theme with <br>
the desired colors.

> I promise xD


You can still play with the **[Old Variants]**.

*Compatible with some windows ( wine ) applications.*

<br>

#### Small Icons

All icons smaller or equal to `24px` are monochromatic, <br>with very few exceptions, preventing consistency break.

So, if you see small colorful icons, it is because they <br>
haven't been covered yet or maybe it's hard-coded.

<br>

#### Transitioning

The package is in the process of migrating to <br>
the new style, so expect icons with the old one.

*I am currently focusing on the most popular.*

<br>

#### Dark Themes

When using dark themes, the small <br>
icons will be visible by bright outlines.<br>
If you don't want this, you can use the [Colorize][Colorize] tool<br>
created by [@ElectronicsArchiver](https://github.com/ElectronicsArchiver) and colorize all<br>
monochromatic icons to your taste. Here's<br>
an example using the included EvolvereDark template:

```./local_path/to/evolvere-icons-repository/Tools/Colorize.js ./local_path/to/evolvere-icons-repository/Resources/Examples/EvolvereDark.yaml"```

<br>

A new directory `Build` will be created on root level<br>
of the Evolvere Icons cloned repository, just rename<br>
it and move to `~/.local/share/icons` or to<br>
`/usr/share/icons` for multi user compatibility.

<br>

#### Live Preview

Open `Resources/preview.svg` <br>
in **[Inkscape]** for a *'live'* preview.
