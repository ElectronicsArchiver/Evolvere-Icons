# Evolvere Icons

***Flat with Touches of Realism***

<br>

![Preview]

</div>

## Design

- Minimalist / Monochromatic
- Realistic Shading

  *As far as I'm able to~*
  
- Smooth Colors
- Square
- Small

## Variants

The variants have been removed and will be replaced with a script that will generate a custom theme with the desired colors (I promise xD). You can play with the old variants in the [old repository](https://github.com/franksouza183/EvolvereSuit).

Compatible with some windows (wine) applications.

## Installation

1. Download the latest **[Release]** .

2. Extract the archive.

3. Place them in corresponding directory:

  **System:** `/usr/share/icons/evolvere-icons`

  **User:** `~/.icons/evolvere-icons`
  
4. Use your theming tool to select it.

## Notes

1 - All icons with sizes smaller or equal to 24px are monochromatic, with very few exceptions, preventing consistency break. So, if you see small colorful icons, it is because they haven't been covered yet or maybe it's hardcoded.

2 - The package is in the process of migrating to the new style, so expect icons with the old one. I am currently focusing on the most popular.

3 - When using dark themes, the small icons will be visible by bright outlines.

4 - Open "preview.svg" in inkscape for a "live" preview.
