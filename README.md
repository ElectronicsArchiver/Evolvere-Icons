# Evolvere Icons 2 for GNU/Linux

### Flat with touches of realism.

This is a project started a few years ago to offer a complete and consistent icon pack. I was forced to take a break for a few years. New icons and adjustments are needed, in addition to the fixes for the issues opened in the old repository.

At the time, I intend icons with vibrant, but not so vivid colors, surrounded by ambient and directional lights. The base shape of the icons keep squared, so if you're already tired of this style, you're in the wrong place. Although the icons tend to be more flat, my main art line is realism, so do not expect a lot of outlines out there, but shadows (albeit subtle)!

The variants have been removed and will be replaced with a script that will generate a custom theme with the desired colors. You can download the old variants in the old repository.

Compatible with some windows (wine) applications.

## Installing

Put the content of this repo into **~/.icons/evolvere-icons-2**

System-wide: **/usr/share/icons/evolvere-icons-2**

And choose it via your theming tool.

## Notes

1 - All icons with sizes smaller or equal to 24px are monochromatic, with very few exceptions such as emblems and some actions icons, thus preventing the break in consistency. So, if you see small colorful icons, it is because they haven't been adjusted yet or maybe it's hardcoded.

2 - The package is in the process of migrating to the new style, so expect icons with the old one. I am currently focusing on the most popular.

3 - When using dark themes, the small icons will be visible by bright outlines.
